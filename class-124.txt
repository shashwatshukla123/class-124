API- Application Programming Interface

Framework in the world of programming is an additional layer of user written code ontop of an already exsist language,so 
that language can be used for application specific cases.

Flask?
Flask is a framework written on python. it's liberary equips us with a lot of useful meathod and functionality 
which we can use to do web development.

Web Framework?
:-A Web Application Framework or a simply a Web Framework represents a collection of libraries and modules that enable web 
application developers to write applications without worrying about low-level details such as protocol, thread management, and so on.

Virtual Environment?
:-Virtual Environment is used to create an isolated for your project. 
Your project can have it's own set-up dependies regardless of what other project might need.

Notes:

All APIs use an HTTP method. Let’s see what they are:

The GET Method -
GET is used to request data from a specified resource. When you access
a website’s page, your browser makes a get request to your API and
your API is returning the front-end that is displayed in the browser.

All the APIs that you create in Flask,by default, use GET Request. If you
start your hello_world server and go to localhost:5000, you can see in your
terminal that the browser made a GET request on the server/API.



The POST Method -
POST is used to send data to the server to create/update a resource.
A user wants to sign up from the signup page? A user wants to change
their password? That would be a post request.


The PUT Method -
PUT is used to send data to a server to create / update a resource.
The basic difference between PUT and POST is that a POST request is
when you can create multiple copies of the same resource.

A PUT request, on the other hand means that you want to create only
one copy of the resource, i.e. Signing Up a unique user.


The DELETE Method -
DELETE is used to delete a resource.The default method used by flask is GET.

Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, 
through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated.
